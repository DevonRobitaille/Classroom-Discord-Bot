Understand the bot:
    - All changes need to be pushed to the github repo to be rebuilt and deployed
    - Heroku will rebuild and redeploy the bot
    - Several channel features will break and need to be updated (register, rules, role-claim), and as such will need to be rebuilt each time the bot goes down

New commands file standard:
    module.exports = {
            commands, <the command name and aliases>
            expectedArgs = '', <A list of expected args, used to let the user know the proper syntax of the command>
            permissionError = "", <The error that gets posted if the user uses the command improperly>
            minArgs = 0, <min number of arguments an individual can send with the command>
            maxArgs = null, <max number of arguments an individual can send with the command>
            cooldown = -1, <how long until the next time the command can be used, measured in seconds>
            requiredChannel = '', <a single channel where the command can be used>
            permissions = [], <all the required permissions to use the command>
            requiredRoles = [], <all the required roles to use the command>
            callback: () => {}, <The function of the command>
        }
